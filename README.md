Drawing Pedigree Charts from Simple Text Descriptions
Proposal
Pedigree charts are used in Medicine to record a patientâ€™s family history. They are particularly useful to document genetic diseases that can be inherited from one generation to the next. The example below shows a pedigree chart of a (fictitious) family where multiple individuals are affected by breast cancer:

In most clinical settings, pedigree charts are still drawn by hand on paper, which limits their utility. Pedigree drawing software tools exist but are complicated to use and/or record their data in proprietary formats that are unsuitable for medical research purposes.

In this project, we aim to develop a pedigree drawing engine that can create pedigree charts as the example above from simple textual descriptions. The concept is similar to Graphviz (https://www.graphviz.org/) and mermaid (https://mermaidjs.github.io/), two projects that allow creating graphs and diagrams using a simple text syntax.

**To be able to use this pedigree engine, R need to be installed. To have a better experience, python3 will be required to install. Python wil auto install any needed python package. But R module kinship2 needed manual install. To install kinship 2 use command 'install.packages('kinship 2') in R console.**


The list of all possible input is listed below.
